# Bank Loan Report Dashboard<br/>
This project focuses on analyzing loan data and creating three interactive dashboardsâ€”Summary, Overview, and Details to facilitate strategic planning and data-driven decision-making for loan portfolio management.<br/>

## Key Features<br/>
1. SQL queries are written, executed, and matched with the dashboard data to ensure output accuracy.<br/>
2. The Summary Dashboard offers insights into loan metrics, categorizing loans as 'Good' or 'Bad' while tracking changes over time.<br/>
3. The Overview Dashboard visualizes lending performance, trends, and parameters through various charts.<br/>
4. The Details Dashboard provides detailed insights into loan portfolios and borrower profiles.<br/>
5. Filter keys such as loan grade, purpose, and verification status are integrated across all dashboards to enhance data exploration and user experience.<br/>
